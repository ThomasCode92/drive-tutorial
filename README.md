### UI Scaffolding

The base UI for this project was created using [v0](https://v0.dev/), a tool
that enables fast UI generation through _vibe coding_. An
[example](https://v0.dev/chat/google-drive-clone-ui-6jEAM0wxOgc?b=b_fFQhsfElqQi&f=0)
of this approach can be seen in Theo’s walkthrough on YouTube.

To apply the same base UI in a project, run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://v0.dev/chat/b/b_fFQhsfElqQi"
```
